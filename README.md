# mgu
This is a framework for visualization in a canvas
The sides of the Canvas are scaleable and it is possible to show horizontal/vertical axis.
It is possible to Zoom in/out or relocate the viewport

There are two mode to use the Canvas
1. You can draw in the coordinate system
2. You can place down objects (Sprites) on the canvas.
The Sprites can have Magnets which are sensitive only for specific other Magnets within the specified distance.
So you can place the Sprite if/when it's Magnet(s) matches to an already placed Sprite's Magnet.
